# Module 2 Project - CRM for insurance company

This repository contains the `.cpp` file developed for **Module 2 - Programming with C/C++**. The software is structured as follows:

1. **OOP structure**:  
The code is organised into classes: Interaction, Appointment, Contract, Client and CRM, following OOP principles. This makes the code modular and easy to extend.

2. **Interaction Management**:  
Interaction management (appointments and contracts) is implemented by using a list to store the interactions associated with each client ID.

3. **Data Saving and Loading**:  
The code provides methods for saving and loading data in a CSV file, useful for data persistence.

4. **Interactive Menu**:  
The user interface is based on a text menu, which is suitable for a console application.
