# Master Course in AI Engineering - ProfessionAI

Welcome to my repository dedicated to the **Master Course in AI Engineering** with **ProfessionAI**. <br> This repository contains all the **final projects** I have developed as part of the course, showcasing the knowledge and skills acquired in each module.

---

## Repository Structure

The course consists of **11 modules**, each ending with a **final project** that applies the concepts learned to a practical, real-world use case. <br>
The repository is structured as follows:
- Each module has its own folder, named with the module number and topic.
- Inside each folder, you will find the corresponding project, named with the project's title.
