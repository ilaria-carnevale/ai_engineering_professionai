## Repository Structure

The course consists of **11 modules**, each ending with a **final project** that applies the concepts learned to a practical, real-world use case. <br>
The repository is structured as follows:
- Each module has its own folder, named with the module number and topic.
- Inside each folder, you will find the corresponding project, named with the project's title.
